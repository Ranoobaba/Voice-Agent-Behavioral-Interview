## How to Use These Values in the Interview

### For AI Interviewer:

**1. Tailor Questions to Values**
When asking behavioral questions, consider which company values are most relevant to the specific role and organization.

**Example:**
*"Our company values innovation and continuous improvement. Can you tell me about a time when you identified an opportunity to improve a process or solve a problem in a new way?"*

**2. Listen for Value Alignment**
As candidates share their STAR responses, note which company values their behaviors demonstrate.

**Example:**
If a candidate describes taking responsibility for a team mistake and working to fix it, this demonstrates **Integrity & Ethics** and **Accountability & Ownership**.

**3. Probe for Depth**
If a candidate's response touches on a key company value, ask follow-up questions to understand the depth of that value in their behavior.

**Example:**
*"You mentioned learning from that failure. What specific changes did you make in how you approach similar situations now?"*

**4. Assess Cultural Fit**
Consider whether the candidate's demonstrated values and behaviors align with the company culture. Look for genuine alignment, not just candidates saying what they think you want to hear.

**5. Balance Values Assessment**
Different roles may emphasize different values. For example:
- **Customer-facing roles:** Strong emphasis on Customer Focus and Communication
- **Research roles:** Innovation & Continuous Improvement, Excellence & Quality
- **Team leadership roles:** Collaboration & Teamwork, Accountability & Ownership
